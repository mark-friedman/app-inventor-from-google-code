This is a repository of publically released pieces of the App Inventor
for Android project.  

Contents:

+ jars/libSimpleAndroidRuntime.jar
    A Jar containing a version of App Inventor's Android runtime
    library.  This library jar file can be used to build Android apps
    in Java that make use of the App Inventor components.

+ samples/HelloHappyFace/
    A sample Android source tree for a simple Android app that uses
    App Inventor components.  Note that unlike the BridgeToJava sample
    it does yet contain all the pieces to build right out of the box -
    it is just illustrative.

+ samples/BridgeToJava/
    A more extensive and annotated sample of using App Inventor
    components in a standard Android Java program.  It can be
    relatively easily built out of the box via ant or imported into
    Eclipse (assuming it contains the Android ADT plugin).  See the
    README file in that directory for more info.

+ samples/AppInventorInJavaSample/
    Another example of using App Inventor components in a standard
    Android Java program.  This one also includes a simple new
    component definition.  Note that unlike the BridgeToJava sample
    it does yet contain all the pieces to build right out of the box -
    it is just illustrative.

+ src/components
    The source code to the App Inventor components.  This is the
    component code that is compiled into the
    jars/libSimpleAndroidRuntime.jar mentioned above.  This code is
    provided mostly for use in understanding the App Inventor
    component architecture and is intended be useful for folks wanting
    to write their own components.
