== App Inventor Issues List: For Bug reports and feature requests ==

Thanks for taking the trouble to file a bug report.   Here are some things to keep in mind:

   * If your issue involves *connecting or communicating with the phone*, do not file a bug report here.  Instead, post to the "Getting Set Up and Connecting Your Phone" section of the [http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum App Inventor Discussion Forum], where you can get advice and help from others who have the same phone.

   * Before filing the report, please scan the list of issues to see if your report duplicates an issue that's already there. When you file a new issue, please select the appropriate template for reporting a bug, versus requesting a feature.  You can also click on the star  to vote on the issue as one that you'd like to see dealt with.  You can also click on the original report and add a comment, rather than creating a new issue.  You can also tell the system to send you email when the issue has been updated.

   * If you are seeking help (not just reporting a bug), you should generally post to the appropriate subgroup in the [http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum App Inventor Discussion Forum] rather than use this bug report tool. In any case, it's a good idea to search in the forum before reporting a bug, to see if other App Inventor community members have commented on the issue. 

  * Note that it is often useful to see the information from the Android log (for problems that occur on the phone or emulator) or the Java Console log (for problem in the Blocks Editor).  Please see the section near the end of [http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/learn/reference/other/testing.html documentation page on testing] for information on how to access those logs.

*Before reporting an issue:* 
Before reporting an issue, please search the list of existing issues to see if a similar one has already been reported.  If so, add a comment or a star to the existing issue rather than filing a new issue.
